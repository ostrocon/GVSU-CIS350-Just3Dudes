# Introduction

The core of our project will be developing a clone of the original DOOM. Since DOOM was first released 30 years ago, there have been many instances of similar-style games. Our goal is to capture a similar feel to the original game. We want the game to have a run-and-gun feel with fast-paced action. Here the users will be able to control a space marine in a single environment. We aim to implement similar controls, weapons, enemies, and level designs into our version. 

We also want to make sure that the feel of the game is kept in our project, however, we do plan to implement some modern updates. We also plan to keep similar controls for the game that allow for movement that is familiar to players. This project will provide us with some experience for our foundations as game developers. 


# Anticipated Technologies

We will probably use Python, PyCharm, and Pygame. Software called Numba which helps run the game. Will probably need to use Google and Youtube to learn any skills we need to make the game. Misc Python quality of life libraries.

# Method/Approach

Step one for our plan of attack is to map out what we are creating. For example, we need to have a rough outline of all of our classes and how they connect to each other, as well as a rough outline of all of our functions and how they work. After this, we can separate these tasks into smaller groups and set up a timeline for when each section will be completed. We will then work on coding these sections, while testing/debugging as we go to make sure everything is compatible and working correctly. Lastly, we will run more tests after the project is completed, making sure it is working properly.


# Estimated Timeline

I estimate that it will take us the longest to make the game is a graphical interface for the game. I suspect that will take us 2-3 weeks but once thatâ€™s done we can start working on creating an environment and making it 3D. This will probably take another 1-2 weeks then we can start working on the player and how we take inputs to make the in-game character do actions, I don't anticipate this will take that long should be done within a week. Then we have to add enemy AI which will probably take another 1-2 weeks.


# Anticipated Problems

We could see issues with using libraries and development techniques we are not familiar with. There could also be problems with the visuals of the game not representing them well enough. 
Creating a map that resembles 3D with walls and other objects.
Making a fair and realistic enemy AI. 
Unanticipated bugs.
