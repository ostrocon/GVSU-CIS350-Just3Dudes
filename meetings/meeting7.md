Discussion points:

*We made the presenation and talked about who will say each part and just talked about our plans to finish the requirements page. We also just talked about how the semester has went and how we are feeling with our project. We all are happy with its place and feel we have done a good job through out the entire semester. 

Goals for next week (include responsibilities)

*our goal is to have a good presentation on 12/4 which we will. Then to continue to work on the requirements and have one final meeting next week to cap the project off. Kaleb might also add some additonal features to the game but that is more just for fun as we are happy where its at currently.
